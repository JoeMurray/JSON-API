# Nymi API Beta Release 3.1

Nymi is now supporting a JSON based API for the development of Nymi Enabled Applications (NEAs). Initially we are providing websocket servers for Mac OS X and Windows.

[Download SDK package here.](https://www.nymi.com/dev)

In the JavaScript directory you will find several very simple JavaScript based examples of how to use the API to accomplish a few basic tasks:

* obtain information about all Nymi Bands in the vicinity
* register a Nymi Band for bound authentication
* finding Nymi Bands that have bound authentication
* watching for events generated by any Nymi Band in the vicinity

We will be adding more examples over the next few weeks.

There is a much more detailed description of what's included in the JavaScript-Examples directory.

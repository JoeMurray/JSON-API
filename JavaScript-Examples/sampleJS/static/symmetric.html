  <h1>Get the symmetric key for each nymiband in the vicinity</h1>
  <h2>(all output is in the javascript console, make sure you have it visible)</h2>
  <p>
  If this is the first time symmetric key is requested for this provision then
  the key created <strong>will not</strong> be guarded by a user gesture. 
  The user will <strong>never</strong> be asked to perform that gesture when retrieving the key.
  </p>
  <p>
  If the symmetric key is guarded, the user <strong>must</strong> perform the gesture before the key
  is retrieved. If the gesture is not performed the operation will fail.
